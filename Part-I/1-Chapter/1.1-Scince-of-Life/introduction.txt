You are about to embark on a jouney - a jouney of dicorey about the natureof life.
More than 180 years ago, a young english naturalist named Charles Darwin set sail on a similar journey on board H.M.S. Beagle;
a replica os this ship is picured here.
What Darwin learned on his five-year voyage led directly to his development of the theory of evolution by natural selection,
a theory that has become the core of the scince of biology.
Darwin's voyage seems a fitting place to begin our exploration of biology - the scientific study of living organisms and how they have evolved.
Before we begin, however, let's take a moment to think about what biology is and why it's important.
